                Technical Areas of Interests:
            </h3>
            <p class="body-text-regular">
                I have an interest in high-performance computing. I was able to explore concurrency programming in my
                Intro to
                Computer Systems
                by building multi-threaded applications designed to complete a task in the shortest time possible. For
                instance,
                I worked on a
                C++ project where I had to escort a rover out of a cave with one billions "rooms" in it, and only one of
                those
                rooms had the exit.

            </p>
            <p class="body-text-regular">
                The finished program was able to explore around eight million rooms a second, with the rover finding the
                exit in
                around
                two minutes.
                I was also able to write a program that counted the word frequency of each and every word in the
                Wikipedia, with
                the
                program processing
                millions of words per second. It was enjoyable being able to make incremental improvements to the
                algorithms I
                designed
                and seeing small
                inefficiencies being corrected resulting in drastic performance improvements.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text-regular">
                I also have an interest in machine learning. I was able to attend and complete a machine learning
                <a href="https://courses.nvidia.com/certificates/b7fafc54ae154739bf233f5d0e71b135" class="external"
                    target="_blank"> workshop from
                    Nvidia</a>, where I learned the
                science behind computer vision and artificial intelligence. From the workshop, I designed a program that
                could
                distinguish an image of a dog versus
                an image of a cat. I also plan to take further online courses in machine learning to learn more in this
                critical
                field.
            </p>

                I have some experience with information technology too. I have completed <a class="external"

                    target="_blank">Google's IT Professional Certificate </a>, which consisted of five courses related
                to the fundamentals of IT, networking, operating systems, systems administration and cybersecurity. As a part-time student technician at my University, I also have hands-on experience
                with customer service and troubleshooting. I help manage a help-desk as part of my work and I assist technicians with setting up computers and managing surplus.
